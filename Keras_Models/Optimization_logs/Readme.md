# Readme for log files

-> The log files included in this folder contain the accuracy and errors recorder during various stages of model training and validation.
-> Each log file contains these metrics for a specific combination of hyperparamters used. 

## Interpreting the log filenames
-> The filenames contain information regarding the hyperparameters used during that specific iteration of optimization.
-> The files are named with the convention "run_(num_user_embeddings)_(num_game_embeddings)_(num_neurons)_(num_hidden_layers)_(optimization_function)_(learning_rate)"

## Visualizing the logs using tensorboard
-> TensorBoard is a great interactive visualization tool that you can use to view the learning curves during training, 
   compare learning curves between multiple runs, vis‐ ualize the computation graph, analyze training statistics, 
   view images generated by your model, visualize complex multidimensional data projected down to 3D, etc.

-> Tensorboard is automatically installed on your device if you have installed tensorflow.

-> To visualize the contents of the files using tensorboard, you need to start a tensorboard server which can be done in two ways

1. Running a command on terminal, this command is shown below in quotes. REMOVE THE QUOTES when running the command.

  Terminal Command : "$ tensorboard --logdir=./mlp_run_logs --port=6006"
  
  "mlp_run_logs" is the file containing the logs. If you have stored the log files in a different folder modify this part of the command accordingly.

  If your shell cannot find the tensorboard script, then you must update your PATH environment variable so that it contains the directory in which the 
  script was installed.

2. Running tensorboard directly within your iPython notebook.

  Run the two lines shown below in your iPython notebook to visualize the log contents. REMOVE THE QUOTES when running the command.
  
  Commands:
  "%load_ext tensorboard"
  "%tensorboard --logdir=./mlp_run_logs --port=6006"

   "mlp_run_logs" is the file containing the logs. If you have stored the log files in a different folder modify this part of the command accordingly.
   
After opening the tensorboard server with the relevant filename, the individual log files can be toggled to visualize the learning curves for the same.
